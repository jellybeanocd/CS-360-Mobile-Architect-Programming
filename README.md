Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
   This app was designed for the purpose of inventory managemant. Companies can use this app to manage their stock of items easier which in turn can help them focus on other things and in the end become more profitable.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
   The application uses four screens including a login, grid view display of inventory, setting and notification, and an add items flow. 

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
   I took my time and tested everytime I finished a section of code. That way if there were errors, and oh boy were there, it was easier to find and figure out.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
   When I finished whatever task I was working on I stopped and ran the program to see what errors were being thrown. Then I would fix them and repeat. 

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
   Time was my biggest enemy. I have a very busy and unfortunately stressful life so that was really holding me back but in the end I got it done. 

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
   This would probably be my experience with Java. I started learning Java before I started school so that gave me an advantage.
